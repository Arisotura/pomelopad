experimental WiiU gamepad emulator

goals:
 * learning more about the WiiU gamepad and its hardware
 * providing a test environment for eventual gamepad homebrew/CFW
 * booting the diagnostics firmware

right now this is a very basic and clunky proof of concept.

files required:
 * firmware.bin - FLASH dump
 * uic_config.bin - UIC config data dump (0x1100-0x1800)
